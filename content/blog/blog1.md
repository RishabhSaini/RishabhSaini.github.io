Free and Open Source Software is becoming wildly popular among businesses and developers. According to a survey by WhiteSource Software, over 70% of companies use open source software in some capacity. Furthermore, 99% of new software projects rely on open source components for their development process. 

What distinguishes closed source software from open-source software is in the duration of trust customers have in it. Closed source software will get replaced by its competitor when there is a chain of unfavorable decisions. When a set of users no longer agree with the direction the project is going, they will simply choose the alternative. A simple organizational change can shift the trust. 

However, in an open source project the code is openly available to the customer and can simply fork it to their use. They can start a discussion in the open-source community and file issues. The trust on the code and community lasts longer than one with the company.
